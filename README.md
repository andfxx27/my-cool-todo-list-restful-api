# my-cool-todo-list-restful-api

RESTful API for my-cool-todo-list frontend project

## Author Notes

- Yeah I know this project is totally not-best-practice (go look at `config/database.go` yourself), but I want to pull through and finish this project if possible.
- Todo list may seems like so basic, it is intended to brush up my Go language knowledge (last used semi seriously during my internship in 2021-2022).
